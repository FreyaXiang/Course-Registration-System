# Course-Registration-System
This is my individual project from the course CSCI-UA 102 Data structures. I create a mock course registration system for a university by using Java OOP concepts. The system allows two types of users: Admin and Student. The admin can perform different tasks: create a new course, delete a course, edit a course, etc. The students can view all courses, register in a course, withdraw from a course, etc.
Almost everything about OOP is included in this project.
